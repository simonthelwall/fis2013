  \begin{block}{Abstract}
  \begin{description}
    \item [Objectives] To determine the susceptibility of \textit{Haemophilus influenzae}, \textit{Streptococcus pneumoniae} and \textit{Staphylococcus aureus} to antibiotics recommended for community treatment of bacterial pneumonia.
   \item[Methods] Antibiotic susceptibility data for \textit{H. influenzae}, \textit{S. pneumoniae} and \textit{S. aureus} from sputum isolates reported between January 2008 and June 2013 were extracted from the Public Health England microbiology database of clinically relevant infections. 
   Data were restricted to isolates from hospital outpatients or specimens referred by General Practitioners for patients in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
   Multivariable Poisson regression was performed to test associations between calendar time and number of resistant isolates reported.
   \item[Results] Data on 180 499 isolates were extracted. 
   There was a consistent increase in the number of isolates reported over the five year period for each organism (\textit{H. influenzae} incident rate ratio 1.11 per year, p\textless0.001, \textit{S. aureus} IRR 1.04, p\textless0.001, \textit{S. pneumoniae} IRR 1.04, p\textless0.001). 
   Resistance to the empiric treatment ampicillin/amoxicillin increased for all three organisms between 2008 and 2013 (\textit{H. influenzae} 23.4\% to 26.3\%, IRR: 1.03, p\textless0.001, \textit{S. aureus} 75.0\% to 80.2\%, IRR: 1.01, p=0.141 and \textit{S. pneumoniae} 2.1\% to 3.9\%, IRR 1.12, p=0.001). 
   Resistance among \textit{S. pneumoniae} isolates rose from 13.4\% to 18.7\% for clarithromycin (IRR 1.10, p\textless0.001), from 11.7\% to 19.5\% for erythromycin (IRR 1.13, p\textless0.001) and from 1.9\% to 2.9\% for any recommended cephalosporin (IRR: 1.41, p=0.003).
   \item[Conclusion] Decreasing susceptibility to recommended antibiotics for bacterial pneumonia is a cause for concern and may impact on the formulation of national guidelines.

  \begin{block}{Introduction}
  Lower respiratory tract infection is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in the UK. \cite{Davies2012}
   Current guidelines for the empiric treatment of bacterial pneumonia in the community recommend either amoxicillin, or, if not tolerated, doxycycline or clarithromycin. \cite{Lim2009}
   The selection of appropriate empiric therapy requires knowledge of the most likely causative organism and its' likely susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.
   Previous work by our group found evidence for declining susceptibility to ampicillin/amoxicillin in \textit{H.influenzae}, \textit{S. aureus} and \textit{S. pneumoniae} and declining susceptibility to macrolides among \textit{H. influenzae} isolates. \cite{Blackburn2011}
   \end{block}
  
  \begin{block}{Methods}
   Data on respiratory isolates of \textit{H.influenzae}, \textit{S. aureus} and \textit{S. pneumoniae} reported to the LabBase2 database between January 2008 and June 2013 were extracted. 
   Isolates from the upper respiratory tract (mouth, larynx, etc) were excluded.
   Data were restricted to isolates from hospital outpatient and general practice patients in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\\
   Isolates were considered resistant if local laboratory staff had recorded the susceptibility of the isolate to a given antibiotic as intermediate or resistant. 
   Where multiple values were recorded for the same isolate and antibiotic, resistant reports took precedence over susceptible reports. \\
   Multivariable Poisson regression with robust standard errors was performed to test associations between calendar time and number of resistant isolates reported.
   %% Need information on interactions here. 
   Age, sex, year, calendar quarter and region were considered potential confounders and were adjusted for accordingly.
   Interactions between age and sex were tested for using likelihood ratio tests. 
   All analyses were performed using R version 3.0.0 and code can be found at \url{https://github.com/simonthelwall/fis2013}.

    \begin{block}{Results}
   Between January 2008 and June 2013 180 499 isolates were reported by \textit{n} labs. 
   \textit{x}(y \%) isolates were from sputum and \textit{x}(y \%) were from patients presenting to GPs. \\
   Between January 2008 and June 2013, there was a consistent increase in the numbers of isolates reported for each organism (figure \ref{fig1}).

  \begin{block}{Discussion}
  Over the last five years we have observed increasing resistance to the first line antibiotic recommended for treating bacterial pneumonia in the community.
  Among \textit{S. pneumoniae} isolates there have been rises in resistance to a wide range of antibiotics. 
  Whether the increases in resistances observed here are due to genuine increases in resistance or whether they are due to increased testing and reporting is difficult to determine. 
  % comparison with other studies here. BSAC?
  The increase in resistance to a range of antibiotics among \textit{S. pneumoniae} is unexpected. 
  The 17-valent vaccine against \textit{S. pneumoniae} was introduced in 20xx and previous studies have noted a decline in resistance following the introduction of previous vaccines. % ref our work here. 
  Utilising data on \textit{S. pneumoniae} serotypes collected by Public Health England might shed further light on this matter. 
  \end{block}
  
  \begin{block}{Conclusions}
  Increases in resistance among organisms isolated from respiratory isolates to first-line antibiotics is a cause for concern and may impact on the formulation of national guidelines.
