abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae remains a leading cause of disease in children and adults. Serotypes differ in invasiveness, virulence, and antibiotic resistance; therefore, serotype surveillance is necessary to monitor the burden of pneumococcal disease, especially in the setting of pneumococcal vaccination programs. The Tigecycline Evaluation Surveillance Trial, (TEST), is an on-going global antibiotic susceptibility surveillance program. Serotypes and antibiotic susceptibilities of 2173 invasive S. pneumoniae in this existing database during 2004-2008 were evaluated. Worldwide, serotypes 19A (28\%), 19F (10\%) and 14 (9\%) were the most common in children under 5 years. In adults over 16 years, 19A (13\%), 3, 6A and 7F (all 7\%) were most common. Serotypes 19A, 6A, 19F, 6B, 15A, 9V, and 14 exhibited significantly higher levels of erythromycin resistance (P<0.05), while 19A, 19F, 35B, 6A, 6B, 23A, 9V, 15A, and 14 demonstrated higher rates of penicillin resistance (P<0.05). This analysis of an existing pathogen database provides a snapshot of global serotype data and describes the consequential issue of antibiotic resistance in specific serotypes, many of which are increasingly common causes of invasive pneumococcal disease.},

@article{Millett2013,
abstract = {Community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) and pneumonia (CAP) are common causes of morbidity and mortality among those aged ≥65 years; a growing population in many countries. Detailed incidence estimates for these infections among older adults in the United Kingdom (UK) are lacking. We used electronic general practice records from the Clinical Practice Research Data link, linked to Hospital Episode Statistics inpatient data, to estimate incidence of community-acquired LRTI and CAP among UK older adults between April 1997-March 2011, by age, sex, region and deprivation quintile. Levels of antibiotic prescribing were also assessed. LRTI incidence increased with fluctuations over time, was higher in men than women aged ≥70 and increased with age from 92.21 episodes/1000 person-years (65-69 years) to 187.91/1000 (85-89 years). CAP incidence increased more markedly with age, from 2.81 to 21.81 episodes/1000 person-years respectively, and was higher among men. For both infection groups, increases over time were attenuated after age-standardisation, indicating that these rises were largely due to population aging. Rates among those in the most deprived quintile were around 70\% higher than the least deprived and were generally higher in the North of England. GP antibiotic prescribing rates were high for LRTI but lower for CAP (mostly due to immediate hospitalisation). This is the first study to provide long-term detailed incidence estimates of community-acquired LRTI and CAP in UK older individuals, taking person-time at risk into account. The summary incidence commonly presented for the ≥65 age group considerably underestimates LRTI/CAP rates, particularly among older individuals within this group. Our methodology and findings are likely to be highly relevant to health planners and researchers in other countries with aging populations.},
